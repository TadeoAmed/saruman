# Initial System Architecture Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-16
**Analyzed by**: AI Software Architect Framework (Initial Setup)

## Project Overview

**Languages**: Go
**Framework**: None detected
**Package Manager**: go mod
**Has Tests**: Yes
**Has CI/CD**: No

## Systems Architect Analysis

### System Structure
- Primary languages: Go

- Testing strategy: Present
- CI/CD pipeline: Not Detected

### Architectural Strengths
- Technology stack appears modern and well-supported

- Testing infrastructure in place

### Areas for Improvement

- Consider setting up CI/CD pipeline for automated quality checks
- Document architectural decisions as the system evolves

## Security Architect Analysis

### Security Considerations
- Framework security: Ensure secure coding practices
- Dependency management: Regular security updates for go mod
- Authentication/authorization patterns need architectural definition

### Security Recommendations
- Establish security review process for architectural changes
- Document authentication and authorization patterns
- Implement security scanning in development workflow

## Performance Specialist Analysis

### Performance Baseline
- Technology stack: Generally performant with Go


### Performance Recommendations
- Establish performance monitoring and metrics
- Define performance requirements for key user journeys
- Consider performance implications in architectural decisions

## Maintainability Expert Analysis

### Code Quality Assessment
- Modern technology stack supports good maintainability practices
- Existing test infrastructure supports maintainable code

### Maintainability Recommendations
- Document coding standards and conventions
- Establish code review process
- Regular refactoring to manage technical debt

## Collaborative Findings

### Immediate Priorities
1. Document current architectural decisions and patterns
2. Establish development and deployment standards

3. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Medium-term Goals
1. Regular architecture reviews as system evolves
2. Performance monitoring and optimization
3. Security architecture documentation

### Long-term Considerations
1. Scalability planning as system grows
2. Technology stack evolution strategy
3. Team knowledge sharing and documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review and customize architectural principles in `.architecture/decisions/principles.md`
2. **Week 1**: Create ADRs for current major architectural decisions
3. **Month 1**: Establish regular architecture review schedule
4. **Ongoing**: Use framework for all significant architectural decisions

## Framework Integration

The AI Software Architect framework has been configured with:
- Architecture team members relevant to your technology stack
- Customized principles based on detected technologies
- Templates ready for ADRs and reviews
- CLAUDE.md integration for AI assistant collaboration
